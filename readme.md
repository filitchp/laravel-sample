# Laravel 5.2 Sample Project

This is a basic Laravel sample project that shows statistics about a user uploaded CSS file. 

The project demonstrates basic use of:
- OOP principles
- MVC design
- Unit testing
- PSR-4 namespaces
- Composer dependency management

NOTE: it is not the intent of this project to include a comprehensize CSS parser that accounts for all corner cases (there are plenty of libraries to chose from).
